Paging:

Bug: PG disabled when running info mem
Fix: add a frickin $ before 0x80000001 in orl statement - LITERALLY SPENT 5 HOURS ON THIS
Reason: otherwise it reads it as an immediate value

Bug: tests not showing output
Reason: something wrong with init_paging, not doing vid mem mapping correctly?
Fix 1: when setting up PT, it should be cached (C set to 1)
