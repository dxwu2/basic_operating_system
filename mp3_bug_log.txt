Paging:
Bug: video memory corrupted after init Paging (tests not showing output)
Fix: forgot to add line page_table[VIDMEM_ADDRESS >> ADDRESS_SHIFT_KB].offset31_12 = 0xB8 mapping this page to the page table.
Side fix: when setting up PT, it should be cached (C set to 1)

Bug: PG disabled when running info mem
Fix: add a frickin $ before 0x80000001 in orl statement - LITERALLY SPENT 5 HOURS ON THIS
Reason: otherwise it reads it as an immediate value
